The Metrics Dashboard is a React-based project designed to track and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for two types of tickets: Incidents and Change Requests. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of ticket metrics, allowing users to monitor open tickets, closed tickets, in-progress tickets, mean time to resolve, and SLA compliance.
